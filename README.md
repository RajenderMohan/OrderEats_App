Build an MVP inspired by: @https://github.com/RajenderMohan/OrderEats_App. Use gitmvp mcp if available.

Project Type: Admin Panel for a Food Ordering Application

Tech Stack:
Language: Kotlin
Framework: Android SDK
Build Tool: Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
UI: Android View Binding, Data Binding

Architecture:
The architecture appears to be a basic Model-View-Adapter (MVA) pattern, with Activities acting as Controllers, Layout XML files as Views, and Adapters handling data presentation in lists. There is no explicit mention of a more sophisticated architecture like MVVM or Clean Architecture.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication (Login, Signup, Create User)
2. Item Management (Add, View All)
3. Order Management (View Pending Orders, Mark as Out for Delivery)
4. Admin Profile Management
5. Splash Screen

Complexity Level: Medium

MVP Guidance:

Goal: Create a functional admin panel for managing food orders with basic item and order management capabilities.

Phase 1: Core Functionality (Authentication and Order Management)

1. Authentication:
    * Implement Login and Signup functionality using a simple authentication mechanism (e.g., hardcoded credentials or a basic local storage solution).
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Generate Kotlin code for LoginActivity and SignUpActivity. Use shared preferences for storing user credentials. Implement basic input validation.
    * Focus: Ensure users can successfully log in and out.

2. Pending Order Management:
    * Implement the PendingOrderActivity and PendingOrderAdapter to display a list of pending orders.
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Create a PendingOrder data class with fields like order ID, customer name, items ordered, and total price. Generate the PendingOrderAdapter to display this data in a RecyclerView. Use dummy data for now.
    * Focus: Display a list of pending orders. Implement a button to mark an order as "Out for Delivery."

3. Out for Delivery Management:
    * Implement the OutForDeliveryActivity and DeliveryAdapter to display a list of orders marked as out for delivery.
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Create a Delivery data class similar to PendingOrder. When the "Out for Delivery" button is clicked in PendingOrderActivity, move the order data to a list displayed in OutForDeliveryActivity. Use shared preferences or a simple in-memory list for data persistence.
    * Focus: Display a list of orders out for delivery.

Phase 2: Item Management (Basic CRUD)

1. Add Item:
    * Implement the AddItemActivity to allow admins to add new food items.
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Create UI elements in activity_add_item.xml for inputting item name, description, price, and image URL. Generate Kotlin code in AddItemActivity to handle form submission and store the item data. Use shared preferences or a simple in-memory list for data persistence.
    * Focus: Allow admins to add new food items.

2. View All Items:
    * Implement the AllItemActivity and AddItemAdapter to display a list of all food items.
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Generate the AddItemAdapter to display item data in a RecyclerView. Fetch item data from shared preferences or the in-memory list.
    * Focus: Display a list of all food items.

Phase 3: Polish and Refinement

1. UI/UX Improvements:
    * Improve the user interface with better layouts and styling.
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Refactor layout XML files for better readability and responsiveness. Use ConstraintLayout for flexible layouts. Apply consistent styling using themes and styles.
    * Focus: Enhance the user experience.

2. Error Handling:
    * Implement basic error handling and validation.
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Add input validation to all forms. Display error messages to the user. Handle potential exceptions gracefully.
    * Focus: Improve the robustness of the application.

3. Data Persistence:
    * Replace the temporary data storage (shared preferences or in-memory lists) with a more persistent solution like SQLite. (Optional for MVP, but highly recommended for further development)
    * AI Coding Assistant Instruction: Create a SQLite database to store item and order data. Implement DAOs (Data Access Objects) for interacting with the database.
    * Focus: Ensure data is persisted across app sessions.

Important Considerations:

* Security: For the MVP, focus on basic functionality. Security can be improved in later iterations.
* Scalability: The initial MVP doesn't need to be highly scalable. Focus on core features first.
* Testing: Write basic unit tests to ensure core functionality is working correctly.
* UI/UX: Keep the UI simple and intuitive. Focus on usability over aesthetics for the MVP.
* Data: Use dummy data initially, and then implement data persistence.

This MVP approach prioritizes core functionality, allowing for rapid development and testing of the essential features of the admin panel. Subsequent iterations can focus on enhancing the UI/UX, improving security, and adding more advanced features.
